# Project4 Pets Insurance Website

## Project Description
> With the increasing rate of people having pets over children in Thailand, we see the business opportunity to deliver an all-in-one service for those people. Hence, the concept of the website is inspired by this change. Therefore, we wish to deliver a well-designed user friendly website for those people to explore, enteract, purchase our package, and keep in contact. Although we mainly focuse on the common pets, we plan to expand toward the exotic pets territory in the future.
